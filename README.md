# Amex Default Prediction

This project is focused on predicting customer defaults for the Amex competition using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a reliable model that can accurately classify whether a customer is likely to default on their payment obligations.

## Project Goals

- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess training and test datasets, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Model Training**: Utilize the LightGBM classifier to train a predictive model
- **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test dataset.
- **Submission Creation**: Compile the customer IDs and their corresponding predictions into a CSV file for submission.

By achieving these goals, this project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and improve the financial decision-making process for credit approvals.
